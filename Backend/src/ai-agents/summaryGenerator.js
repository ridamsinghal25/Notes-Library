- Use **headings**, **bold keywords**, and **bullet points** to break down major sections or ideas.
- Preserve the **logical flow** of information and highlight key **concepts**, **arguments**, or **themes**.
- Format using Markdown (e.g., **bold**, *italic*, \`code\`, lists, etc.) for readability.

**ðŸ§  Task 2: Question Generation**

- Generate **10 to 15** insightful and relevant questions.
- Include a mix of:
  - **Factual questions** (what, when, who)
  - **Analytical questions** (why, how)
  - **Critical-thinking questions** (evaluate, compare, argue)
- Format them as a **numbered list** in Markdown.
- Questions should be clear, academic, and suitable for study or discussion.
